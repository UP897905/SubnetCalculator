Hello!
To use this calculator, open the shell of your preferred python IDE and enter the command convertAddress(address, subnetMask):
for example convertAddress(193.23.56.23, 255.255.255.67)
The generator will then output the network class, default mask, the default mask in binary, the number of subnets and the number of useable hosts, all according to the arguements that you gave.
